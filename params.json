Now open your damn .NFO files like a man, man.\r\n\r\nThis is basically just a shell alias to `iconv -f cp437 -t utf8`.\r\n\r\nI recommend using the included font, `Terminus`, as your Terminal font.  But `Andale Mono`, `Monaco`, and `Menlo` will work too.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---\r\nTo install, `cd` into the project's directory and do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat script installs an alias to your `.bashrc` called `nfo` and installs `Terminus.dfont` to `/Library/Fonts`.\r\n\r\nIf you can't run `install.sh`, make sure you `chmod +x install.sh`.  But you knew that already.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n---\r\n```\r\nnfo <filename>\r\n```\r\n\r\n===\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, phracker <phracker@lavabit.com>\r\nThis software is licensed under the ISC License.\r\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this\r\nsoftware for any purpose with or without fee is hereby\r\ngranted, provided that the above copyright notice and\r\nthis permission notice appear in all copies.\r\n\r\nhttp://opensource.org/licenses/ISC\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS\r\nALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
