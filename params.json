{"name":"termNFO","tagline":"The terminal .nfo viewer for Mac OS X","body":"termNFO\r\n===\r\nGUIs are for pussies, kiddies, and wannabes.  I'm looking at you `Ascension`.  Now open your damn .NFO files like a man, man.\r\n\r\nI recommend using the included font, `Terminus`, as your Terminal font.  But `Andale Mono`, `Monaco`, and `Menlo` will work too.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---\r\nTo install, `cd` into the project's directory and do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo ./install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat script installs an alias to your `.bashrc` called `nfo`, installs `Terminus.dfont` to `/Library/Fonts`, drops a build of `realpath` in `/usr/bin`, and copies `termNFO.app` to the `/Applications` directory.\r\n\r\nFor optimal viewing use the included `TermNFO.terminal` profile as `Terminal.app`'s default profile.\r\n\r\nFile association is fully working using the included .app on systems running Mac OS X 10.6 or later.\r\n\r\nIf you can't run `install.sh`, make sure you `chmod +x install.sh`.  But you knew that already.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n---\r\nYou can use termNFO in either of two ways.  You can do `nfo <filename>` at the terminal or you can associate .nfo files with termNFO.app.\r\n\r\nFeedback?
