I recommend using the included font, `Terminus`, as your Terminal font.  But `Andale Mono`, `Monaco`, and `Menlo` will work too.

###Installation

To install, simply:

```
git clone https://github.com/phracker/termNFO && cd termNFO
bash install.sh
```

That script places the `nfo` function in `~/.nfo`, and adds a line to `~/.bashrc` to call it.

`Terminus.dfont` and `TermNFO.terminal` ensure optimal viewing, but are not required.

###Usage:
After install, you shouldn't need to reload your shell. Try it out!

`nfo <filename>`
