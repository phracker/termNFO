I recommend using the included font, `Terminus`, as your Terminal font.  But `Andale Mono`, `Monaco`, and `Menlo` will work too.

###Installation

To install, simply:

```
git clone https://github.com/phracker/termNFO && cd termNFO
bash install.sh
```

The installer places the `nfo` function in `~/.nfo`, and loads it from `~/.bash_profile`.

`Terminus.dfont` and `TermNFO.terminal` ensure optimal viewing, but are not required.

###Usage:
After install, reload your shell and try it out!

`nfo <filename>`
